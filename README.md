## Step-by-step

### Generating synthetic dataset

![dataset](./docs/dataset_example.png)

You can generate a synthetic dataset from a volume saved as a tensor.
In folder ```data``` there is an example of a volume compressed (```cloud_grid.zip```) and a HDR environment (```environment00.zip```).
Decompress at the root of ```data```. 
Execute the script ```generate_dataset.py```.

It takes around 01h15m in a GTX 3090 (preview images will be shown during the process).
The file ```cloud_dataset.pt``` should have be saved in the created folder ```datasets```.
The dataset contains the rendering for 80 different camera poses of 512x512 pixels, with 16K spp.

### DRT Pipeline

The baseline of our method is the sampling strategy implemented in
*Unbiased Inverse Volume Rendering With Differential Trackers* by Merlin, et al.

Executing the script ```reconstruct_ms_DRT.py``` we get the reconstruction using the aforementioned technique.
The constant BW_TECHNIQUE represents the sampling strategy used for the gradient propagation through the path.

- DRT: Differentiable Ratio-tracking
- SPS: Our Singular Path Sampler
- DRTDS: The defensive sampling used in DRT
- DRTQ: DRT in its quadratic form.
- DT: Vanila Delta Tracking without defensive strategy.

All these techniques can be tested in a pipeline that progressively reconstruct a medium from a coarse resolution to the final.
Using 10K iterations distributed among 4 levels.

The final reconstruction can be found at folder 
```python
f'./reconstructions/{DATASET}_drt_ms_{BW_TECHNIQUE}.pt'
```

### SPS Pipeline

The proposed pipeline in our paper requires an initial reconstruction with a Absorption-Emission model first.

The difference with the proposal in DRT is that our emission field relax in-scattered light in anisotropic case by using a Spherical Harmonics grid.

In order to generate such reconstruction has to be executed the script ```reconstruct_ae.py```. After this, a file at
```python
f'./reconstructions/{DATASET}_ae_{SH_LEVELS}.pt'
```
contains the reconstructed field of densities and emissions.
Our SPS pipeline will only make use of the densities.

Executing ```reconstruct_ms_SPS.py``` we reconstruct now using the three components proposed in our paper.

- An initial density from a relaxation of the in-scattering radiance.
- The singular path sampler.
- An exponential moving average to enhance the primal computation and avoid deviated gradients.

The final reconstruction can be found at folder 
```python
f'./reconstructions/{DATASET}_sps_ms_{BW_TECHNIQUE}.pt'
```

## Evaluation

The script ```eval_reconstructions.py``` allows to compare two reconstructions with respect to a reference volume and image.
